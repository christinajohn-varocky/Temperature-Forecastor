# Introduction
Temperature forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the temperature informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.

# Problem Statement
Forecasting the climatic conditions in Bangalore based on historic monthly climate data of Bangalore from 2009 to 2019.

We did it using VAR model
Vector autoregression (VAR) is a statistical model used to capture the relationship between multiple quantities as they change over time. VAR is a type of stochastic process model. VAR models generalize the single-variable (univariate) autoregressive model by allowing for multivariate time series.

variables we are considering over here are 
temperature
pressure
wind gust
percipitation

Fitted VAR model by checking and and satisfying the assumptions.
